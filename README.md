## Full Stack with Spring Boot and React

* The localStorage and sessionStorage properties allow to save key/value pairs in a web browser.
* The sessionStorage object stores data for only one session (the data is deleted when the browser tab is closed)

* To ensure that header menus are updated whenever the router is called we need to wrap HeaderComponent with a call to withRouter.

* Spring Boot is an open source Java-based framework used to create a Micro Service. It is developed by Pivotal Team.
* Spring Boot contains a comprehensive infrastructure support for developing a micro service and enables you to develop enterprise-ready applications that you can “just run”.
